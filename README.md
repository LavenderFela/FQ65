# FQ65 keyboard

_tl;dr FQ65 is 65% keyboard inspired by Keycult and Geistmaschine luxury keyboards. Purpose of the project is to create a similar looking alternative which would be more affordable for custom mechanical keyboard enthusiasts._

## Parts used
### KBD67 Rev2 PCB [Confirmed]

While it is possible to buy original [Keycult PCBs](https://keycult.com/collections/accessories), (un)availability and price of 65$ excluding shipping makes them rather unappealing choice. KBD67 Rev2 is a solderable PCB which allows for both ANSI and ISO support, as well as split spacebar, backspace and stepped caps lock. At the moment, only this PCB is planned to be supported, but I might add support for other 65% PCBs later (DZ65, KBD67 MKII, KBD67 Lite).

### Daughterboard [TBD]

_GMMK Pro daugtherboard will be used because of its wide availability._

### Switches

Any MX style switch will work and as the PCB has southfacing sockets, no switches will introduce keycaps interference. My personal build will be using Gateron Ink Black V2 switches filmed with Durock Dual-Layer Switch Films, lubed with 205g0 and spring-swapped to 60g TX Long springs.

### Stabilizers

Screw-In stabilizers will be needed, amount of them depend whether split spacebar and backspace are chosen. I will be using Durock V2 with PTFE/Silica gel films for softer bottom out which I have previously tried in my current personal build.

## Layout
FQ65 is based on solderable KBD67 Rev2 PCB, but case top will have a blocker near the arrows thus reducing possible layouts. The .svg down below shows all the supported layouts:
- ANSI and ISO
- Stepped Caps Lock
- Split Backspace and Space
